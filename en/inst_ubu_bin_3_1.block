<h2 id="check_env">Before you begin</h2>
<p><span style="color: red">
* The SSE extension command is validated in the binary package of OpenHRP. It does not operate in CPU before Pentiumâ…¢,Athlon XP.
</span></p>
<p>
Since OpenHRP is an application based on 3D Graphics, it is necessary to confirm whether 
your pc is aware of handling 3D Graphics properly, before you begin installation. To 
confirm that, open a Terminal window and run following command;
</p>

<pre>$ glxinfo | grep rendering</pre>
<p> </p>

<ul>
  <li><p>
  If the result is: "direct rendering: Yes"<br>
  Your system is capable of handling 3D graphics. Please proceed to the next section.</p>
  </li>
  <li><p>
  If the result is: "direct rendering: No"<br>
  You have to install a graphics driver, that supports 3D acceleration feature.</p>
  
  <ul>

  </ul>

   <p>Note:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
     <p>
     Depending on the graphics board, sometimes the above procedure may not be applicable for your 
     system.Even in this case, basically OpenHRP itself is working.But the 3D visualizations 
     may become slower and would not perform effectively, due to the inactivity of 3D acceleration. 
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
     Regarding the graphics board, we can assure that the boards having nVidia chipsets, 
     would support 3D acceleration feature well in Linux platfoems.
     </p>
    </li>
    <li>
     <p>
     For Ubuntu guest platforms running on virtual machine environments, we have confirmed that the 
     3D graphics works fine even without installing a proper graphics driver.

<h2 id="bin">Installing OpenHRP3 from a binary package</h2>
<p>
Distribution of the binary package by apt-get is supported after OpenHRP3.1.0. &beta;4.<br>
</p>

<h3 id="file_structure">Composition of a file </h3>
Installation directories are the following composition. <br>
<pre>

</pre>
</p>

<p>
Since it is dependent on OpenRTM-1.1.0, it does not operate in old version. <br>
Please install in the following procedures. 
</p>

<h3 id="bin_apt-get">Using apt-get</h3>
<p>
Please execute the following command to install an openhr package. 
<pre>
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:hrg/stable
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:openrave/release
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openhrp
</pre>
Please choose "Yes" or "accept", and finish installation.<br>
<br>

<h4 id="chk_java">A check of the third party of Java </h4>
<pre>$ java -version</pre>
Please check the third party of java. <br>
If the sentence of "Java (TM) SE Runtime Enviroment" is displayed jre of Sun is effective.<br>
If the sentence of OpenJDK Runtime Environment" is displayed jre of OpenJDK is effective.<br>
Please check that Sun or OpenJDK is effective, then continue <a href="#bin_install_grxui">Installation of Eclipse and GrxUI plug-in</a>. <br>
If it is not displayed, please execute the following command.<br>
<pre>$ sudo update-java-alternatives -s java-6-sun</pre>
or
<pre>$ sudo update-java-alternatives -s java-6-openjdk</pre>
</p><br>

<h3 id="bin_install_grxui">Installation of Eclipse and GrxUI plug-in </h3>
GrxUI is plug-in of Eclipse. The present version corresponds to Eclipse3.4. <br>
We prepared the package which all contains required plug-in.<br>
Please download Eclipse all-in-one package from <a href="./download.html">"download"</a> page and extract it. <br>
<pre>
tar xzvf eclipse342_hrpdependencies_linux_en_20120220.tar.gz
</pre>
Please copy all the jar files in /usr/share/OpenHRP-3.1-/java/plugins/ directory to the plugins directory of Eclipse. 
<br>
For example, when a current directory is an eclipse directory, please execute the following command. 
<pre>$ cp /usr/share/OpenHRP-3.1/java/plugins/*.jar plugins/</pre>
<br>
Installation is completion now. The next is <a href="./init_grxui.html">Starting and initial setting of GrxUI</a>.
