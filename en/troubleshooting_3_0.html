<h2>Platform Independent Problems</h2>

<h3>Cannot open the model files created with OpenHRP previous versions</h3>

<p>
We have made few changes on the model file format. Locate following line, under <i>"Proto Joint"</i> 
definition:
</p>

<blockquote>
  exposedField SFFloat jointId -1
</blockquote>

<p>Edit the above line as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  exposedField SFInt32 jointId -1
</blockquote>


<h3 id="start_hang">GrxUI stuck at start-up</h3>

<p>
This problem can be resolved by clearing the contents of omniNames(omniORBs' name server).
</p>

<p>
Once the CORBA objects are created, omniNames name server would try to keep them stored 
as a log file. To recover from this issue, just delete the log file and re-start omniNames.
</p>

<p>
For instance, let's say we have installed omniORB package on Ubuntu platform.
Once omniNames is started the temporary files named "omninames-(HostName).bak" and 
"omninames-(HostName).log" will be created at /var/log . Delete these temporary files and
move into /etc/init.d . Restart the name server as follows;
</p>
<pre>
$ ./omniorb4-nameserver restart
</pre>
<p>
Since the name server is cleared, OpenHRP would be started as normally.
</p>


<h3>Modaless dialog at GrxUI start-up remains displayed</h3>

<p>
This problem is different from <a href="#start_hang">"GrxUI stuck at start-up"</a> problem.
GrxUI is active and operatable, but the modaless dialog that displays at GrxUI start-up, keep 
remains on the top of the screen without disappearing. It will be gone, when you do some 
activities like loading sample project etc. However this problem is now fixed in OpenHRP Ver.3.0.3 .
</p>
<br>

<h3>Change is not reflected even if you change the contents of VRML file. </h3>
<p>
The modelloader of OpenHRP3.0 has the function to cache the contents of the file read before.
For this reason, those contents are not reflected even if you change the contents of a file, without a file name changing. 
Please reboot GrxUI or reboot ModelLoader. 
</p>

<h2>Linux Specific Problems</h2>

<h3>3D view of GrxUI is abnormal / Program stucks (On Linux)</h3>

<p>
When "Direct Rendering" feature is activated for OpenGL displays on X-Windows systems, 
this kind of troublesome situations could take place, due to the 3D-rendering unsupported 
graphics drivers. Deactivating "Direct Rendeing" can cause to slower the 3D graphics, 
but it would let GrxUI to execute as normal.
</p>

<p>
Concretly speaking, we have noticed this type situation, when running Ubuntu 7.10 on a 
notebook PC that have Intel GM965 chipset onboard. In that case, we deactivated direct-
rendering by appending following line under [Section "Device"] in /etc/X11/xorg.conf file.
</p>
<pre>
Option "DRI" "false"
</pre>
<p>
Then restarted X-windows system. Direct rendering was disabled and the program execution 
got back to normal.
</p>
<p>
Probably, this may be a bug of OpenGL driver or Java3D.
</p>


<h3>X-Windows system freezes during GrxUI execution (On Linux)</h3>

<p>
This issue can be occur, when the X-Window display-driver has not been configured properly 
for OpenGL. In this case, you have to re-install an OpenGL supportive display-driver.
</p>
<p>
 For video adaptors such as nvidia or ATI, there are display-drivers provided by manufacture, 
that aimed for better support on OpenGL. Installing these specific display-driver would 
resolve the problem. (For more details, refer <a href="./g3d_support.html">here</a>)
</p>


<h3 id="gcj_sun_error">Compile errors / Java exceptions occurs after applying Ubuntu system updates (On Linux)</h3>

<p>
When installing OpenHRP3 we 
<a href="./install_ubuntu.html#switch_java">set 'Sun-java' as default java environment</a>. 
But when applying Ubuntu system updates, it renews 'Java-gcj' to its latest version and set as 
default java environment automatically, which may cause to compile errors or Java exceptions when 
starting GrxUI.
</p>

<p>When starting GrxUI, it may hang-up giving following messege;
<pre>
$ ./GrxUI.sh
message logging level : SEVERE
classpath added: file:/home/user/aist/OpenHRP3.0/client/gui/plugin/
/home/user/aist/OpenHRP3.0/client/gui
Null peer?!
</pre>
</p>

<p><a href="./install_ubuntu.html#switch_java">Switching the default java environment</a> 
back to 'Sun-java', will resolve the problem.</p>

<pre>
$ sudo update-java-alternatives -s java-6-sun
</pre>

<p>
If you are not willing to use 'gcj' for any other applications, you can uninstall it, so that the 
problem will never be take place.
</p>


<h3>Display empty dialog boxes when Extra-visual-effects are applied in Ubuntu environment (On Linux)</h3>

<p>
This problem could only be noticed in native Ubuntu environments (not in virtual Ubuntu environments 
running on VMware). When trying to open a project file, the dialog box goes empty as shown in Fig.1 .

<center>
<img src="../img_new/trouble/white_dlg.png" align="top"><br>
Fig.1
</center>
</p>
<br>

<p>
Resetting the visual-effects settings to "None", will resolve this issue.<br>
The procedure is as follows;<br>

Goto <i>"System"</i> &rarr; <i>"Preferences"</i> &rarr; <i>"Appearance"</i> on menubar. (Fig.2)<br>
<center>
<img src="../img_new/trouble/view_config1_en.png" align="top"><br>
Fig.2
</center>
</p>
<br>

<p>
"Appearence Preference" dialog box will be pop-up. Move to "Visual Effetcs" tab, select "None" 
radio-button and close the dialog box. (Fig.3)
<center>
<img src="../img_new/trouble/view_config2_en.png" align="top"><br>

</p>
<br>

<h3 id="error_ipv6_localhost">RTC on "GrxUI on Eclipse" does not work on Ubuntu-9.04 </h3>
<p>
If you install OpenHRP for the first time on Ubuntu-9.04 environment, RTC based sample models may 
not work on "GrxUI on Eclipse". In such case, open terminal window and run,
<pre>
$ openhrp-aist-dynamics-simulator -ORBInitRef NameService=corbaloc:iiop:localhost:2809/NameService
</pre>
if you get the output as follows,

<pre>
IDL:omg.org/CORBA/TRANSIENT:1.0
</pre>
the problem has occured because ipv6 on Ubuntu-9.04 has not been enabled by default.<br>
<br>
To resolve this problem, locate <i>"/etc/hosts"</i> file and comment-out the line 
<i>"::1        localhost ip6-localhost ip6-loopback"</i> where keeps localhost settings of IPv6.
</p>

<h3>A ModelLoader server cannot be accessed from other PCs. </h3>
Now, the ModelLoader server on ubuntu cannot be accessed from other PCs with the interface of CORBA. 
The cause is unknown.

<h3 id="compileError_rtmUpdate">A compile error happens at the time of update of the system after 2009/05/25, or new installation of OpenHRP.</h3>

<p>
After 2009/05/25, if update of ubuntu or new installation of OpenHRP is performed, OpenRTM-aist-1.0.0-RC1 will be installed.
In OpenHRP of 2009/06/09 present, since OpenRTM-aist-1.0.0-RC1 is not supported, the following compile errors occur. 
<pre>
error: ExtTrigExecutionContextService_var in namespace RTC does not name a type
error: RTC::ExtTrigExecutionContextService has not been declared
error: ExtTrigExecutionContextService_ptr is not a member of RTC
</pre>
Please cope with it as follows according to a case. 
</p>
<br><br>

<h2>Windows Specific Problems</h2>

<h3 id="ns_error">OmniORB name server does not start (On Windows)</h3>
<p>
When trying to start GrxUI on Windows environments having OmniORB version 4.1.2 installed, 
a messege saying "3DVIEW : failed to bind to localhost NameService" can be displayed as 
shown in figure below and fails starting GrxUI.
</p>
<p>
<center>
<img src="../image/failed_bind.png" align="top"><br>
Fig.1: failed to bind to localhost NameService
</center><br>
</p>

<p>
This type of error occurs when the 'Computer name' of your computer could not be identified 
correctly.
</p>
<p>
If your computer name is longer than 14 characters or if it contains characters other than 
[A-Z,a-z,0-9,'_'] , that may cause problems.You can check your computer name and re-define, 
according to the following procedure.
</p>
<p>
Open "System Properties" dialog box using one of the following method.
</p>
<p>
* Right-click "My Computer" icon on the Desktop, and click "Properties" in the menu.<br>
* Press "Start" button, right-click "My Computer" and click "Properties" in the menu.<br>
* Press "Start" button, select "Run". Enter "sysdm.cpl" in the text box and hit "OK".<br>
* Press "Start" button, browse in to "Control Panel" > "System".
</p>
<p>
Select "Computer name" tab in the opened dialog box and check whether your computer name is 
in right order. Click "change" button if you want to re-define it. Then restart the computer to 
apply the changes.
</p>


<h3>3D view of GrxUI is abnormal (On Windows)</h3>
<p>
For some video adaptors, when the GrxUI 3DView frame is kept smaller, 3D model start 
flickering and vertex-buffer collapses.The cause is not yet confirmed, but according 
to the phenomenon we saw on a note-book pc, it seems like a malfunction of video adaptor.
</p>
<p>
However, enlarging the frame size of GrxUI tab window, may resolve the matter.
</p>


<h3>Displays 3D-device error at GrxUI start-up (On Windows)</h3>

<p>
For some environments, it gives following error messege when starting up GrxUI, and the 
program exits.
</p>

<blockquote>Fail to create referance rasterizer 3D Device - D3DERR_NOTAVAILABLE</blockquote>

<p>According to article at 
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/191660/en" target="_blank">
http://support.microsoft.com/kb/191660/en</a>, this issue may occur due to any of the 
following reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Your computer does not meet the minimum 3D hardware requirements to run GrxUI</b></li>
  <li><b>Your video adapter does not have sufficient video memory to run GrxUI</b></li><br>
    Resolution:
    <ol>
      Reason(1) and reason(2), mean that the hardware equipments in your pc such as CPU, 
      RAM, video-RAM etc, does not satisfy the minimum requirements to run 3D graphics. 
      Therefore you have to check which equipments does not meet the requirements and 
      replace those with better ones.
      <p>
      Here we provide the hardware spesifications of a computer that can run OpenHRP at 
      optimum condition. Refer these specifications and compare with yours.
      <ul>
        <li>CPU: PentiumIV 2Ghz</li>
        <li>RAM: 1024MB </li>
        <li>Video adaptor: NVIDIA</li>
        <li>Video RAM: 128MB </li>
        <li>HDD space available: 5GB</li>
      </ul>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>"DirectDraw Acceleration" is disabled</b><br>
    Resolution:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Click "Start" > "Run". Enter "dxdiag" in the textbox and press OK.
        "DirectX Diagnostic tool" window will be opened.
      </li>
      <li>
        Select "Display" tab. Check out the status of "DirectDraw Acceleration" and "Direct3D 
        Acceleration". If the status of any of those are "Disabled", press "Enable" button 
        along with.
      </li>
      <li>
        In case of "Enable" button is not active(state that cannot press), go through the 
        resolutions of section (4) and (5).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Video adaptor drivers are out-of-date</b><br>
    Resolution:
    <ul>
      If you use older version of video driver, the above accelerator features would not 
      be supported. In this case, you have to search for the latest compatible (better if 
      stable) driver version for your video adaptor and install it. At most cases, latest 
      drivers can be found at makers' homepage. It will be easier for you to find download 
      location, by searching internet for driver name that displays under "Device Manager" > 
      "Display Adaptor" section.
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>DirectX version you are using is not up-to-date or damaged</b><br>
    Resolution:
    <ul>
      Go to "DirectX Diagnostic tool" > "Display" tab, as explained in section (3). Run 
      "DireactDraw Test" and "Direct3D Test". You will see some graphical displays during the 
      tests. If it does not displayed correctly, the tests will fail and we can say that your 
      DirectX-run-time-engine is performing abnormal.In that case, download the latest 
      <a href="http://www.gamesforwindows.com/en-US/aboutgfw/Pages/directx10-a.aspx" target="_blank">DirectX installer</a> 
      and re-install DirectX.
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>One or more programs that are running in the background are interfering with the game</b><br>
    Resolution:
    <ul>
      While running GrxUI, if you keep running any 3D graphics application softwares at 
      back-ground that uses DirectDraw and Direct3D features, it can be difficult to handle 
      and cause to slower the execution of all running applications. (However, handling 
      applications depends on the performance of your pc). In this case, please shut down 
      the unusing applications and try again.
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>


<h3>System freezes while GrxUI being execute (On Windows)</h3>
